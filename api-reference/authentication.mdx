title: 'Authentication'

The Chargily Pay API uses API keys for request authentication. You can access and manage your API keys on [the Developers Corner in the Chargily Pay Dashboard](https://pay.chargily.io/dashboard/developers-corner "the Developers Corner in the Chargily Pay Dashboard").

<Note>Requests made over plain HTTP (non HTTPS) and authentication-less (without providing an API key) will result in failure.</Note>

<Warning>Make shure to NEVER share your secret API keys in public places such as GitHub or client-side code.</Warning>
